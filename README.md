Most of files in this dataset are not released officially from Cairo metro authority.
Due to lack of official data, we have done some interviews , and performed statistical analysis from summarized reports to generate detailed data to run the simulation.

You will find data about line one infrastructure layout, timetable, passenger arrival, and Origin-Destination matrix (ODM).

In the below, a list of the dataset files:
1- Infra_Line1.xml --> Infrastructure details of Cairo metro line 1 (toplogical data is correct but distances between stations are not)

2- CMC_railML_Infra_ex.xsd--> A custom extenstion to railML prepared by us to add needed data in our problem (e.g. station passenger capacity , and station storage capacit)

3- l1_wd_plan.json --> Line plan for metro line 1, line plans are used to determin some important operational parameters such as headway time and train frequency per hour. This line plan is prepared according to interviews with the metro technical team

4- Line_1_ODM.csv--> calculated origin-destination matrix "passenger routes"

5- SimTimetables --> Timetable files per hour ("calc_timetable_5.xml" is the timetable for 5AM hour), again these files are caclulated based on th line plan.

6- Line1 Actual Daily Figures--> A summerized report shows the average number passengers arrrives to line 1 during a week. we used this file to distribute the arrival numbers over the statoins using normal disribution.

7- Passenger Arrival Per Minute (folder) --> These figutables are estimated for the first 3 hours by a Poisson process using the file mentioned in point 6.

N.B.
- Infrastructure and timetable data are in railML format, to know more about railML please visit "www.railML.org"

- The ODM file is generated by assuming a probability distribution of passenger routes of line 1
