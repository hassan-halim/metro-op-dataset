Most of files in this dataset are not released officially from Cairo metro authority.
Due to lack of official data, we have done some interviews , and performed statistical analysis on summarized reports to generate detailed data to run the simulation.

You will find data about line one: infrastructure layout, line plan, timetable, passenger arrival, and Origin-Destination matrix (ODM).

In the below, a list of the dataset files:
1- Infra_Line1.xml --> Infrastructure layout of Cairo metro line 1 (topological data is correct but distances between stations are not)

2- CMC_railML_Infra_ex.xsd--> A custom extension to railML prepared by us to add needed data in our problem (e.g. station passenger capacity , and station storage capacity)

3- l1_wd_plan.json --> Line plan for metro line 1, line plans are used to determine some important operational parameters such as headway time and train frequency per hour. This line plan is prepared according to interviews with the metro technical team

4- Line_1_ODM.csv--> calculated origin-destination matrix "passenger routes"

5- SimTimetables --> Timetable files per hour ("calc_timetable_5.xml" is the timetable for 5AM hour), again these files are calculated based on the line plan.

6- Line 1 Actual Daily Figures--> A summarized report shows the average number passengers arrives to line 1 during a week. we used this file to distribute the arrival numbers over the stations using normal distribution.

7- Passenger Arrival Per Minute (folder) --> These tables are estimated for the first 3 hours by a Poisson process using the file mentioned in point 6.

N.B.
- Infrastructure and timetable data are in railML format, to know more about railML please visit "www.railML.org"

- The ODM file is generated by assuming a probability distribution of passenger routes of line 1
